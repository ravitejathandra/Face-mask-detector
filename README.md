# Face-mask-detector
This project is an idea that popped up when COVID-19 pandemic was spreading violently. When offline classes were about to start at our college, me and my professor worked on a code to monitor the students and allow only those who wore masks. This involved analysing the real-time data with the help of the model and giving green if the students have masks and red if they don't. I would like to appreciate my professor who helped me to complete this project.
